# SDG Build

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/open-sdg/sdg-build.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/open-sdg/sdg-build)

SDG Build is a Python package for converting data on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) from one format into another. This is mainly useful to an SDG reporting platform, by providing these benefits:

1. Input of SDG data from various machine-readable formats, for human-friendly visualisation and display
2. Output of SDG data to various machine-readable formats, for interoperability with other systems
3. Validation of the data and metadata for quality control

## Inputs

SDG Build can **input** SDG data in the following formats:

* Data in CSV files (long/tidy format)
* Metadata in YAML files
* Data (and minimal metadata) from SDMX-JSON and SDMX-ML
* Data from a CKAN instance

## Ouputs

SDG Build can **output** SDG data in the following formats:

* A particular JSON structure for data and metadata, expected by the [Open SDG](https://github.com/open-sdg/open-sdg) reporting platform.

## Alterations of data and metadata

Sometimes you may need to alter data and/or metadata before importing into this library. This can be done after instantiating the input objects, with `add_data_alteration` and `add_meta_alteration`. For example:

```
def my_data_alteration(df):
    # Drop an unnecessary column in the data.
    df = df.drop('unnecessary_column', axis='columns')
    return df
def my_meta_alteration(meta):
    # Drop an unecessary field in the metadata.
    del meta['unnecessary_field']
    return meta
my_data_input.add_data_alteration(my_data_alteration)
my_meta_input.add_meta_alteration(my_meta_alteration)
```

## Schemas

SDG Build requires a schema for any metadata. Currently the following formats are supported:

* YAML schema intended for Prose.io

## Translations

SDG Build can also import translations and use them to produce fully-translated builds. The translations can also be exported as well. Input formats include:

* SDMX DSD
* YAML local files
* YAML Git repository

The export formats include:

* JSON

## Upcoming integrations

Other inputs and outputs are either under development or planned for the future:

* Output to SDMX, both SDMX-JSON and SDMX-ML
* Input and output from/to CSV-W
* Input and output from/to GeoJSON

## Usage

Usage examples are available in `docs/examples`. In each of these examples, the output is generated in a `_site` folder. Before running these examples, make sure to run:

```
pip install -r docs/examples/requirements.txt
```

### Example #1: CSV + YAML to Open SDG

An example conversion from CSV data and YAML metadata into JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform:

```

```

### Example #2: SDMX-JSON to Open SDG

An example conversion from SDMX-JSON (from an API endpoint) into JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform:

```
python docs/examples/sdmx_json.py
```

### Example #3: SDMX-ML to Open SDG

An example conversion from SDMX-ML into JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform:

```
python docs/examples/sdmx_ml.py
```

### Example #4: CKAN instance to Open SDG

An example conversion from CKAN data to JSON suitable for the Open SDG platform:

```
